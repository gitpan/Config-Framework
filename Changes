Revision history for Perl extension SecsupConfig.

2.0		Wed Apr 17 16:50:56 2002
		original revision to use AutoSplit
2.2.1	Fri Apr 25 11:27:00 2002
		multiple files can now be loaded in New
2.2.3	Wed May 22 14:47:00 2002
		fixed typo in New
2.2.4	Fri June 13 12:29:34 2002
		added Debug option ... only thing it does is prevent mail from being sent out
		of AlertAdmin. Maybe more later. Right now, it's just convinient.
2.2.6	Wed, 6/26/02 11:19:00
		added logging to AlertAdmin
2.2.7	Thu, 6/27/02 13:07:12
		added Log as separate method -->this is where Syslog stuff will go eventually
2.2.8	Wed, 7/3/02 12:27:03
		Added complete POD documentation. No code changes.
2.2.9	Thu, 8/15/02 12:59:32
		Added Carp to Log function, if Echo is defined. This is a nice way of echoing
		log stuff to std out ... say if you want to have easy debugging output.
2.3.0	Mon, 8/26/02 10:53:50
		Fixed location of AutoLoadUserCfg under $obj, not $data in New
		Fixed logical flow error in LoadUserCfg which caused no config to load unless it was copied.
		Fixed syntax error in LoadUserCfg: $obj => $self ;-)
		Oops! forgot to specify AltLoc in LoadUserCfg ... fixed that too.
2.3.1	Thu, 10/10/02 12:36:22
		fixed logging error in AlertAdmin. File option is depricated.
		send log file on Log option now.
2.3.2	Fri, 10/11/02 10:02:42
		added 'AsymetricLogging' option to new. If set to a nonzero value, this option will 
		background all of the logging processes with the shell '&'. This is good if you want to
		do lots of fast, repetative logging, but don't want to need to wait on disk updates.
		of course the downside to this is that you can't garantee that your logfile will be in 
		strict chronological order.

Changed namespace to Config::Framework.

1.0		Mon Oct 21 11:13:14 2002

		added WriteConfig
1.04	Tue, Mar 18 17:30:00 2003
